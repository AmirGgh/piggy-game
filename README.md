# piggy game

Two players roll dice by turn. player keeps rolling and accumulates points. the player can decide to hold and save the points or keep going. if the dice is 1, the player loses one live point, and all points he collected at this turn will be lost. then the other player's turn comes.
Each player have 5 live points, and each of them tries to get to 100 point first (with one live point at least)
The Player who loses all live points is losing the game.

(The game was originally from Jonas Schmedtmann's course, I added the live point and logic by my self)
